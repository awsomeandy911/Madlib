    \ninally, it was Bob's turn to meet the {adj} interviewer, who had a collection of {pluralN} shaped like famous {celeb} heads. The interviewer asked, ""If you were a {fooditem}, what flavor would you be?""\
    \nBob didn't hesitate and said, ""I'd be {adj} cheese, because I'm sharp and always up for a good {noun}!""\
